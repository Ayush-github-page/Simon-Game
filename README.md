Simon Game: A browser based interactive game

Objective
- To design and implement a browser-based interactive memory game that enhances user engagement.
- To apply front-end web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery) in building a fully functional application.
- To reinforce knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic design through a practical project.

Process
1. Game Design
- Defined rules and logic for the Simon memory sequence game.
- Planned UI layout with buttons, animations, and score display.
2. Implementation
- Developed front-end structure using HTML and CSS.
- Implemented JavaScript and jQuery for:
• Detecting button clicks and keypress events.
• Randomly generating and storing game sequences.
• Validating user responses against generated patterns.
- Incorporated animations and sound effects to enhance gameplay feedback.
3. Testing and Debugging
- Validated event-handling functions and game reset logic.
- Debugged edge cases (e.g., incorrect input, level restart).
  
Outcome
- Delivered a responsive and engaging Simon Game playable on any modern browser.
- Strengthened understanding of DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and interactive UI design.
- Improved problem-solving and logical structuring skills through game algorithm implementation.
- Created a fun, interactive project demonstrating proficiency in front-end web development tools.
